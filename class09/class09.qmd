Today we will take a wee step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy. 


## 1. Data Import

```{r}
candy <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

>Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```


> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```


## 2. What is your favorate candy?

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s `winpercent` value?

```{r}
candy["Twix",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the `winpercent` value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```


> Q5. What is the `winpercent` value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```


## Expoloratory Analysis

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset. 

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

It looks like the last column `candy$winpercent` is on a different scale to all others. 

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the `candy$chocolate` column?

```{r}
candy$chocolate
```

0 indicates it is a chocolate candy, while 1 indicates that it is not a chocolate candy.  

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values.

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, fill="lightblue")
```


> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

Not symmetrical, the histogram is right-skewed. 

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

No, because the median is below 50%. 

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

The average of chocolate candy: 

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[ choc.inds, ]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

The average of fruity candy:

```{r}
fruit.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruit.candy <- candy[ fruit.inds, ]
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

Another way of finding the mean for fruity candy, it is still working but hard to read and understand. 
```{r}
fruit.win <- candy[ as.logical(candy$fruity),]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```


> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
ans
```
 
There is a statistically different with a p-value of 2.871e-08, which indicates there's more chocolate candy than fruity candy.  


Yes with a P-value of `r ans$p.value` .

```{r}
ans$p.value
```


## 3. Overall Candy Rankings 

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()` 

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x)
```

```{r}
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <- order ( candy$winpercent ) 
head( candy[inds,], 5 )
```


> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail( candy[inds,], 5 )
```

Another way of finding the top 5 all time favorite candy types: 
```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = T)
head( candy[inds, ], 5 )
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on `winpercent` values.

Make a bar plot with ggplot and order it by winpercent values

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the `reorder()` function to get the bars sorted by `winpercent`?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill="pink")
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x=winpercent, 
      y=reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent), 
      fill=chocolate) +
  geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want - with `chocolate` and `fruity` candy together with whether it is a `bar` or not. 

```{r}
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

#mycols
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent)) + 
  geom_col(fill=mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=8)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst 


## 4. Winpercent vs Pricepercent

```{r}
# Pink and grey is too light, lets change to red and black   
mycols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 8) 

```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of `winpercent` for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
tail( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```


> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```


## 5. Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

chocolate (dark blue circle) and fruit (dark red circle) are negatively correlated. 

```{r}
round( cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2 )
```


> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

chocolate and bar are positively correlated. 

```{r}
round( cij["chocolate", "bar"], 2 )
```


## 6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset. 

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary(pca)
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
#pca$x
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps=6, col=mycols) +
  theme_bw()
```



The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot. 

```{r}
#pca$rotation
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill=PC1) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, pluribus, and hard. It does make sense to me because these candy types are the least popular combination with chocolate.
